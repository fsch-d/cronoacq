# CronoACQ
This is a simple interface to acquire and store data from 3 ndigo-5G boards and 1 ndigo-250m board (see https://www.cronologic.de).

Drivers for the Ndigo cards are available here: https://github.com/cronologic-de.

The code uses the widget qcustomplot https://www.qcustomplot.com/. It can be compiled with Qt creator.

A sample code for the analysis of the acquired data is here: https://github.com/fsch-d/Go4CronoACQAnalysis (specifically the file Go4CronoACQEventSource.cpp).
